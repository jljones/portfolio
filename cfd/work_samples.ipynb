    "\n",
    "The work shown here was performed using the CFD package called Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). FDS is an open source, free CFD package built and maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). FDS, available [here](http://firemodels.github.io/fds-smv/) is similar to the [capabilities](http://www.ansys.com/staticassets/ANSYS/staticassets/resourcelibrary/brochure/ansys-capabilities-16.0.pdf) of commercial CFD codes such as [ANSYS Fluent](http://www.ansys.com/Products/Simulation+Technology/Fluid+Dynamics). \n",
    "\n",
    "FDS has capabilities for modeling fluid flow, heat transfer, pyrolysis, and combusion. It is best suited for simulating physical systems with simple geometries, since the physical model used in the simulations has to conform to an underlying rectilinear grid. For most of the work I did in FDS, I was focusing on transport phenomena and the physics of the underlying problem, instead of complex geometries. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the design of any sort of guidevanes, blades, or devices such as turbines, ANSYS Fluent would likely be a better match for handling these more complicated geometries.\n"
